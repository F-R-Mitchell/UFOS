### Overview

The original data was very unorganized and unpractical. Dana was interested in creating a display where information could be easily accessed and displayed. The original webpage was only able to filter the data using date whereas the purpose of the project was to add more filters for city, state, country, and shape. 

### Results

The list of table filters:

As seen above, the user had 7 options to filter the data. The last option, "Comments", shouldn't be used to filter specific things, rather it should be used to filter keywords possibly within a comment such as "huge" or "lights". The first 6 filters can be used solely or in tandem with each other in order to view more specific results.

### Summary

A drawback of the webpage is the limited data, yes you're able to use multiple filters but there isn't enough data which makes the number of filters seem redundant. The first recommendation would be to add more data to see the full practicality of the 7 filters. Another recommendation would be to customize the webpage more to seem more professional. Although it works as it should, it looks too plain.
