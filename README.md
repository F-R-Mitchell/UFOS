### Overview

The original data was very unorganized and unpractical. Dana was interesting in creating a display where information could be easily accessed and displayed. The original webpage was only able to filter the data using date whereas the purpose of the project was to add more filters for city, state, country, and shape. 

### Results

The list of table filters:

As seen above, the user had 7 options to filter the data. The last option, "Comments", shouldn't be used to to filter specific things, rather it should be used to filter key words possibly within a comment such as "huge" or "lights". The first 6 filters can be using solely or in tandem with eachother in order to view more specific results.

### Summary

A draw back of the webpage is the limited data, yes you're able to use multiple filters but there isn't enough data which makes the amount of filters seem redundent. The first recommendation would be to add more data to see the full practicality of 7 filters. Another recommendation would be to customize the webpage more to seem more professional. Although it works as it should, it looks too plain.
